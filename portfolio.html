          Hi, I’m Minh Thanh. I am a 3rd year university student, currently
          majoring in graphic design - UI/UX Design. I have a source of passion
          for creativity, however I find them more apparent in UI/UX. Right now,
          I've only been working on it for 5 months but I'll try my best to
          train my UX skills so that I can become a UX Researcher.

      <p class="intro">
        I regret that I had to suspend my face-to-face study at FPT for more
        than 1 year because of the covid epidemic, so my knowledge was only
        known through online learning. But I found my passion for UI/UX work
        through a friend. My days of homeschooling are no longer boring, I
        decided to learn more about it, and at the same time learn more
        knowledge about graphics to improve myself.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        After all those years of the pandemic, I was able to directly do an
        internship in my chosen field, which is UI/UX at Capi Creative. The
        first time I was here, I felt very confused and didn't know what to do
        in this environment. But thanks to the kindness and meticulousness of
        the brothers and sisters here, I got used to my work very quickly. At
        the same time, I have trained my knowledge/level in a more scientific
        and advanced way. But as that is not enough, I still need to train
        myself more in UX to be able to go further in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="intro">
        And I have decided to stay for a trial period for 1 more month, then I
        will try to become a full-time employee to learn a job here. I do not
        regret my decision because learning is always necessary at this age, to
        be ready to face difficulties in the future. If I am lazy in this field,
        I will be far behind everyone, and I will not be able to become the
        pride of my family.
